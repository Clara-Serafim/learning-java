# Learning Java ☕  

Repository created to track my journey learning Java.  

## What I’ve learned so far  
- Java basic syntax  
- Variable types (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, `String`)  
- Difference between single quotes and double quotes (`char` vs `String`)  
- Math operators (+, -, *, /, %)  
- Variable scope and how to avoid naming conflicts  
- Using `System.out.println()` to print values  

## Next steps  
- Control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`, loops`)  
- Methods (functions in Java)  
- Classes and objects (OOP)  
- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Java Collections  
- File handling  
- GUI programming  

---  
✨ Goal: keep improving my Java skills, documenting my progress, and turning this repository into a learning diary!
